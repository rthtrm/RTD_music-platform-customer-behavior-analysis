# User Behavior Analysis on Music Streaming Platform "S" ðŸŽ¶
## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of user activity on an online music streaming platform, "S". The analysis focuses on understanding the behavior of users in two different cities, with particular emphasis on the following areas:
- **Streaming patterns on weekdays vs. weekends**
- **Differences in music preferences between the two cities**
By analyzing these patterns, this project aims to uncover insights that could help the platform "S" optimize its service for different user segments based on their location and streaming habits.

## Key Objectives
**Weekday vs. Weekend Streaming Behavior:**
We investigate how users from each city engage with the platform on weekdays compared to weekends. This analysis can help in understanding the potential for peak engagement times, user habits, and whether different types of content perform better on specific days.

**Music Preferences Across Cities:**
We compare the music preferences of users from the two cities. Are there distinct differences in genre popularity? Are users in one city more likely to stream certain types of music than those in the other city?


## Methodology
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Initial steps include cleaning the dataset, handling missing data, and transforming time-based features to distinguish between weekdays and weekends.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
We performed EDA to visualize user activity trends over time, comparing city-specific behaviors. Key plots were generated to display streaming volumes by day of the week and genre preferences in each city.

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas)
Jupyter Notebook
GitHub (for version control)

## Key Findings
Irrespective of location, listeners show pattern in playing tracks of certain genre on every Friday evening until Monday morning. 
Music preference varies little among listeners, where Pop is most popular genre in both cities. 

## Conclusion
Personlized content recommendation based on days of the week or occassion as opposed to location.
